        <h2 className="transparent-text">Introduction to Letrsets.com</h2>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          Letrsets.com offers a unique blend of fun and intellect, challenging
          players to find words of varying lengths using a specific set of
          letters. This engaging game, available in multiple languages,
          including English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish, not only
          tests your vocabulary but also your strategic thinking. Unlike other
          word games, Letrsets.com comes with a twist: single letter sets always
          appear at the end of the word, and using the hint button won't cost
          you points.

        <h2 className="transparent-text">The Basics of Letrsets.com</h2>
        <h3 className="transparent-text">How to Play</h3>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          Playing Letrsets.com is simple yet addictive. Players are given sets
          of letters from which they need to construct words of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
          and 8 letters long. The challenge lies in identifying the possible
          word combinations from the given letters, with longer words offering
          the chance to score higher points.

        <h2 className="transparent-text">Game Features</h2>
        <h3 className="transparent-text">Languages Available</h3>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          One of the most appealing features of Letrsets.com is its availability
          in five languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish.
          This diversity makes it a global game that crosses language barriers,
          inviting players from different linguistic backgrounds to join in the
          fun.
        </p>

        <h3 className="transparent-text">Point System</h3>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          Another unique aspect is the game's scoring system. Points are awarded
          based on the length of the word, and interestingly, using hints does
          not deduct points, allowing players to learn and improve without
          penalty.

        </h2>
        <h3 className="transparent-text">Understanding Word Lengths</h3>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          Strategies for 3-4 Letter Words: Starting with shorter words can help
          players ease into the game, gradually building their confidence and
          strategic approach to tackling longer words.
        </p>

        <h3 className="transparent-text">Strategies for 5-8 Letter Words</h3>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          For the more ambitious players, focusing on 5-8 letter words from the
          outset can be a rewarding strategy. This approach requires a keen eye
          for possible word combinations and the patience to sift through the
          letters.
        </p>

        <h3 className="transparent-text">Leveraging Single Letter Sets</h3>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          Remembering that single letter sets will always be at the end of the
          word can significantly narrow down the possibilities, making it easier
          to identify the correct words.
        </p>

        <h3 className="transparent-text">Utilizing the Hint Button Wisely</h3>
        <p className="transparent-text">
          Though the hint button does not affect points, strategic use can make
          the difference between a good score and a great score. It's a tool for
          learning and improving your gameplay over time.
